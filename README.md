# Tic Tac Toe — Sample Vibe Coding Project

This is a sample project built for learning purposes, exploring what it means to
**vibe code** — describing what you want in plain language and letting an AI assistant
generate the implementation.

No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies. Just a single `index.html` file.

## What we built

A browser-based Tic Tac Toe game with the following features:

- A clean dark-themed UI with an SVG game board
- White grid lines, blue X's, and red O's
- Smooth draw animations for each move
- Player name setup screen before the game starts
- Winner congratulation screen at the end of each game
- Option to play again with the same players or start fresh with new ones
- Running score tracker (wins, losses, ties) when continuing with the same players

## How it was made

The entire project was vibe coded — the only input was a plain-English description
of what the game should look and behave like. Claude Code translated that into a
fully working single-file web app.

## How to run

No installation needed. Just open `index.html` in any modern browser.
